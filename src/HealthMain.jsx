                <h2>Bone Fractures In Cats</h2>
                <p>
                    Cats, with their nimble agility, are often seen defying gravity. But even these graceful creatures can stumble, leading to an unfortunate bone fracture. 
                    Knowledge about feline bone health and fractures is crucial for any cat owner. 
                    At the heart of every cat's acrobatic prowess lies a marvel of nature: a skeleton composed of 244 individual bones. 
                    This intricate framework, bound together by ligaments, gifts our feline friends with a blend of strength and flexibility that's truly extraordinary.
                    What sets cats apart from most mammals is the unique design of their skeletal system. 
                    Their bones aren't as tightly knit together, which allows for those awe-inspiring, flexible spine movements.
